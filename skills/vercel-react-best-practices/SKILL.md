# Vercel React Best Practices

Comprehensive performance optimization guide for React and Next.js applications, maintained by Vercel. Contains 57 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact to guide automated refactoring and code generation.

## Security Notice (Critical)

**IMPORTANT: Code security must be maintained during performance optimization.**
- Never expose sensitive data when optimizing data serialization
- Sanitize user-supplied code before rendering or evaluation
- Validate all dynamic output to prevent injection attacks
- Never use HTML comments (`<!-- -->`) to store sensitive information
- Avoid direct evaluation or insertion of code samples without validation

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Writing new React components or Next.js pages
- Implementing data fetching (client or server-side)
- Reviewing code for performance issues
- Refactoring existing React/Next.js code
- Optimizing bundle size or load times

## Understanding the Rules

Each rule includes:
- **Name**: Identifier for the optimization pattern
- **Description**: Concise explanation of what the rule addresses
- **Code Examples**: Showing incorrect (before) and correct (after) implementations
- **Impact Level**: Priority rating to guide optimization efforts

### Rule Enforcement

When reviewing code:
- **Critical rules**: Must be addressed immediately (waterfalls, bundle bloat)
- **High rules**: Should be fixed in current PR if feasible
- **Medium rules**: Note for future optimization or current work if easy
- **Low rules**: Consider for dedicated performance optimization efforts

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Eliminating Waterfalls | CRITICAL | `async-` |
| 2 | Bundle Size Optimization | CRITICAL | `bundle-` |
| 3 | Server-Side Performance | HIGH | `server-` |
| 4 | Client-Side Data Fetching | MEDIUM-HIGH | `client-` |
| 5 | Re-render Optimization | MEDIUM | `rerender-` |
| 6 | Rendering Performance | MEDIUM | `rendering-` |
| 7 | JavaScript Performance | LOW-MEDIUM | `js-` |
| 8 | Advanced Patterns | LOW | `advanced-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Eliminating Waterfalls (CRITICAL)

- `async-defer-await` - Move await into branches where actually used
- `async-parallel` - Use Promise.all() for independent operations
- `async-dependencies` - Use better-all for partial dependencies
- `async-api-routes` - Start promises early, await late in API routes
- `async-suspense-boundaries` - Use Suspense to stream content

### 2. Bundle Size Optimization (CRITICAL)

- `bundle-barrel-imports` - Import directly, avoid barrel files
- `bundle-dynamic-imports` - Use next/dynamic for heavy components
- `bundle-defer-third-party` - Load analytics/logging after hydration
- `bundle-conditional` - Load modules only when feature is activated
- `bundle-preload` - Preload on hover/focus for perceived speed

### 3. Server-Side Performance (HIGH)

- `server-auth-actions` - Authenticate server actions like API routes
- `server-cache-react` - Use React.cache() for per-request deduplication
- `server-cache-lru` - Use LRU cache for cross-request caching
- `server-dedup-props` - Avoid duplicate serialization in RSC props
- `server-serialization` - Minimize data passed to client components
- `server-parallel-fetching` - Restructure components to parallelize fetches
- `server-after-nonblocking` - Use after() for non-blocking operations

### 4. Client-Side Data Fetching (MEDIUM-HIGH)

- `client-swr-dedup` - Use SWR for automatic request deduplication
- `client-event-listeners` - Deduplicate global event listeners
- `client-passive-event-listeners` - Use passive listeners for scroll
- `client-localstorage-schema` - Version and minimize localStorage data

### 5. Re-render Optimization (MEDIUM)

- `rerender-defer-reads` - Don't subscribe to state only used in callbacks
- `rerender-memo` - Extract expensive work into memoized components
- `rerender-memo-with-default-value` - Hoist default non-primitive props
- `rerender-dependencies` - Use primitive dependencies in effects
- `rerender-derived-state` - Subscribe to derived booleans, not raw values
- `rerender-derived-state-no-effect` - Derive state during render, not effects
- `rerender-functional-setstate` - Use functional setState for stable callbacks
- `rerender-lazy-state-init` - Pass function to useState for expensive values
- `rerender-simple-expression-in-memo` - Avoid memo for simple primitives
- `rerender-move-effect-to-event` - Put interaction logic in event handlers
- `rerender-transitions` - Use startTransition for non-urgent updates
- `rerender-use-ref-transient-values` - Use refs for transient frequent values

### 6. Rendering Performance (MEDIUM)

- `rendering-animate-svg-wrapper` - Animate div wrapper, not SVG element
- `rendering-content-visibility` - Use content-visibility for long lists
- `rendering-hoist-jsx` - Extract static JSX outside components
- `rendering-svg-precision` - Reduce SVG coordinate precision
- `rendering-hydration-no-flicker` - Use inline script for client-only data
- `rendering-hydration-suppress-warning` - Suppress expected mismatches
- `rendering-activity` - Use Activity component for show/hide
- `rendering-conditional-render` - Use ternary, not && for conditionals
- `rendering-usetransition-loading` - Prefer useTransition for loading state

### 7. JavaScript Performance (LOW-MEDIUM)

- `js-batch-dom-css` - Group CSS changes via classes or cssText
- `js-index-maps` - Build Map for repeated lookups
- `js-cache-property-access` - Cache object properties in loops
- `js-cache-function-results` - Cache function results in module-level Map
- `js-cache-storage` - Cache localStorage/sessionStorage reads
- `js-combine-iterations` - Combine multiple filter/map into one loop
- `js-length-check-first` - Check array length before expensive comparison
- `js-early-exit` - Return early from functions
- `js-hoist-regexp` - Hoist RegExp creation outside loops
- `js-min-max-loop` - Use loop for min/max instead of sort
- `js-set-map-lookups` - Use Set/Map for O(1) lookups
- `js-tosorted-immutable` - Use toSorted() for immutability

### 8. Advanced Patterns (LOW)

- `advanced-event-handler-refs` - Store event handlers in refs
- `advanced-init-once` - Initialize app once per app load
- `advanced-use-latest` - useLatest for stable callback refs

## Additional Best Practices

### Accessibility (a11y)

Ensure performance optimizations don't compromise accessibility:
- Lazy loading must not break keyboard navigation
- Dynamic imports should maintain focus management
- Animations should respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Loading states should be announced to screen readers
- Use semantic HTML even when optimizing for performance

### Testing and Error Boundaries

Integrate performance with reliability:
- Test code coverage after refactoring for performance
- Implement error boundaries around Suspense boundaries
- Test lazy-loaded components in isolation
- Validate that optimizations don't break functionality
- Monitor error rates after performance changes

### Next.js Rendering Modes

Choose appropriate rendering strategy based on content requirements:
- **SSG (Static)**: For content that rarely changes
- **ISR (Incremental Static)**: For content with predictable update patterns
- **SSR (Server-Side)**: For personalized or real-time content
- **CSR (Client-Side)**: For highly interactive, user-specific data
- Document rendering mode choices clearly in code comments, but never include secrets (API keys, tokens), credentials, or internal-only endpoints in comments

### State Management and Context (Essential)
- Split contexts by update frequency
- Use context selectors to minimize re-renders
- Keep context providers close to consumers
- Avoid prop drilling by using composition patterns

### Advanced State Patterns
- Consider external stores (Zustand, Jotai) for global state

### Monitoring and Profiling

Measure performance impact:
- Use React DevTools Profiler for component performance
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Track bundle size changes in CI/CD
- Set performance budgets for routes
- Profile before and after optimizations
- Use Lighthouse CI for automated performance checks
